SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6

LIMIT 20;


-- 1) How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!
SELECT
    COUNT(*)
    FROM  BIT_DB.JanSales
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID';
      
    -- There were 9,681 orders in January
    

-- 2) How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT
    COUNT(*)
    FROM  JanSales
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
        AND Product = 'iPhone';

    -- Of the 9,681 orders in February, 379 of them were iPhones! 



-- 3) Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT
    customers.acctnum
    FROM BIT_DB.customers customers
    JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales feb 
        ON customers.order_id = feb.orderID
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

    -- See output. 


-- 4) Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT
    jan.Product,
    MIN(jan.price)
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
        AND orderdate IS NOT NULL;
    
    -- AAA batteries (4-pack) was the cheapest item sold. It was 2.99.



-- 5) What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT 
    jan.product,
    ROUND(SUM((jan.Quantity)*jan.price),2) as jan_revenue
    FROM BIT_DB.JanSales jan
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
    GROUP BY jan.product;
        
    -- See output. 

-- 6) Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT 
    feb.Product,
    feb.Quantity,
     ROUND(SUM((feb.Quantity)*feb.price),2) as total_revenue
    FROM FebSales feb
    WHERE length(orderid) = 6
        AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
        AND location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
    GROUP BY feb.Product;

    -- Only two AA-batteries(4-pk) were sold to this address, totaling $7.68.



-- 7) How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
    COUNT(customers.acctnum),
    ROUND(AVG((feb.Quantity)*feb.price),2) as avg_spending
    FROM customers
    JOIN FebSales feb
        ON customers.order_id = feb.orderID
        WHERE length(customers.order_id) = 6
        AND customers.order_id <> 'Order ID'
    HAVING COUNT(feb.Products) > 2;
    

    --There were 13,005 customers who order more than two products at a time in February and they spent an average of $190.
